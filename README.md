# Yu-Gi-Oh! Axum API

Small project developed as a challenge between coworkers to promote using
technologies we don't typically use during our daily activities, in which
we gave each other 2 weeks to research languages, frameworks and develop 
an API connected to a MongoDB for CRUD operations.

## Endpoints
- Get data by ID.
- Get all cards data.
